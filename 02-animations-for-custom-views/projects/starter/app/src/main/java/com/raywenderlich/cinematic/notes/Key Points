* It's easier to work with complex animation when you break them down into smaller individual
animations
* You can reverse animations by calling the reverse() function.
* You can create different value animations for different components of a custom view.
* When creating a value animator on text size it needs to be an sp value, so you can divide the
animated value by the screen density.
* A custom view's animations can be fine turned and abstracted away from the custom view's consumer,
keeping the code simple and the animations concise.
